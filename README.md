# web-scrapper

The script only demonstrated web broswer automation with Python, Browser Drivers and Selenium.
I have used Google Chrome(Windows version) to test and run the script. 
Please check your chrome version then download the appropriate version from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
